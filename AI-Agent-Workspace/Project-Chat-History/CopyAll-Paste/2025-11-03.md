- Captured the full 2025‑11‑02 dev-day narrative in 2025-11-02.Summarized.md, covering all 19 turns, autosummarization hydrations, key artefacts, and forward path.
- Appended a commit correlation section tying hashes 58ef23a8 → fc3025e4 to their corresponding turn ranges so the audit trail matches the user’s git log.

Tests not run (documentation-only change).

If you want a double-check, skim the new summary’s Commit Correlation block to confirm the mappings align with your intent before tagging the checkpoint.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Thank you for completing that! Now, can you please update the user intent census with any salient signals from the 11/2 dev day? Today is 11/3 and this is how we tend to begin our dev days. These steps help prime the autosummarizations to leave a lasting impression of project history. This initial immersion into project history appears to have strong positive benefits for day-over-day continuity. #file:user-intent-census.md

**Census Update**
- Expanded user-intent-census.md with a full 2025-11-02 intent ladder, capturing all requested quotes (L1–L2102) on summaries, migration evidence, commit discipline, telemetry parity, and autosummarization recovery.
- Updated supporting metadata—sources list, prompt counts (11/02: 36), top-theme item #10, both workspace-guardrail lists, and observed prompt-category breakdown—to reflect the new day.
- Documented the autosummarization rehydrate mandate and the push to retire synthetic telemetry in favor of CopyAll exports so future agents inherit the same guardrails.

Tests: not run (documentation-only change).

Next steps:
1. Re-run `python validate_census.py --summary census_validation.json --transcript AI-Agent-Workspace/Project-Chat-History/CopyAll-Paste/2025-11-02.md` to confirm MIG-005 remains satisfied with the new census chunking.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Follow instructions in [speckit.implement.prompt.md](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Chat-History-Intelligence/.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md).
you are clear to continue implementation from where we left off yesterday. As you say:

You should indeed re-run that to ensure that we have not regressed on MIG-005.

- Requirements checklist count succeeded after retrying with a PowerShell-based matcher (the earlier Python inline command hung).  
- Here’s the status:

| Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| migration.md | 10 | 10 | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| requirements.md | 22 | 8 | 14 | ✗ FAIL |

Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)

jfjordanfarr: yes

- Ran `validate_census.py` against all labeled transcripts (`2025-10-21` … `2025-11-02`); census_validation.json refreshed with full coverage, zero errors, and tail gaps capped at 96 lines (well below the 1,200-line MIG-005 limit). Validator now raises only advisory warnings about sub-200 line gaps inside the 11/02 ladder—no action required unless you want to add finer-grained chunks.

Next steps:
1. If we’d like to silence the 11/02 gap warnings, add intermediate census chunks for the uncovered ranges.
2. Revisit the requirements checklist when ready to close the remaining 14 open items.

**Census Updates**
- user-intent-census.md: Added fresh 2025-11-02 chunks (151-350, 351-589, 701-879, 951-1068, 1601-1883) and extended the closing segment to 2198 so every transcript span is quoted and summarized, eliminating the validator gap. Also captured brief context bullets for the new and existing sections to highlight the enforced directives.

**Validation**
- `python validate_census.py … --transcript …/2025-11-02.md` → all labels report full coverage with **Warnings: none**, **Errors: none**.

**Next Steps**
1. Review the new untracked transcript 2025-11-03.md and decide whether to keep or stage it.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: The new untracked transcript will be committed alongside progress checkpoint commits. The record of how each commit formulated lives alongside the commit itself. It's something of an auditability dream come true. In any case, we could commit now at this minor progress checkpoint before continuing to remaining development items.

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: Set-Location "d:/Projects/Copilot-Chat-History-Intelligence"; git add .mdmd/user-intent-census.md AI-Agent-Workspace/Project-Chat-History/CopyAll-Paste/2025-11-03.md

Ran terminal command: Set-Location "d:/Projects/Copilot-Chat-History-Intelligence"; git status -sb

Extended the 2025-11-02 entries in user-intent-census.md so every chunk is line-referenced through the transcript tail, then re-ran `python validate_census.py …` to show all labels at full coverage with zero warnings. Added the latest `CopyAll-Paste/2025-11-03.md` transcript (and staged it alongside the census) so the audit trail stays complete for the upcoming checkpoint commit.

- Staged: user-intent-census.md, 2025-11-03.md
- Suggested commit message: `docs: refresh census chunks and add 2025-11-03 transcript`
- Tests: not run (documentation-only change)

Next up, continue the remaining spec-kit development items as planned (e.g., CHK-014/016/017) once you’re ready to resume implementation after this checkpoint.
